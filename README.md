# Real_NVP-pytorch
This repo consists of the implementation of the paper [Density estimation using Real NVP](https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.08803) in pytorch. I would really like to thank Eric Jang for his blog which you can find [here](https://blog.evjang.com/2018/01/nf1.html). Please do go through the blog if you are interested in Normalising Flows and are new to this concept. The code which I have written is inspired from his implementation using jax.
